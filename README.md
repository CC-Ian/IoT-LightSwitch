# An Open Source "IoT" Lightswitch
This project seeks to implement a wifi connected, computer controlled lightswitch which protects the user's privacy, and has more features than a traditional light switch.

## DANGER! LETHAL VOLTAGES

This project is not for the inexperienced. There is exposed AC Mains present on the PCB, and installation requires modifying the AC Mains Connection within a switch box.  

## FIRE HAZARD WARMING
This product is designed to switch on and off a ceiling fan and a light or two. The mains traces are rated at 6A for a 10 degree rise over ambient. Install a 5A fuse in the location on the PCB, and ensure that your load is less than 5A before using this device.
